        "The paper describes the system for the 4$^{th}$ Shared task on *Detecting Signs of Depression from Social Media Text* at LT-EDI@RANLP 2023, which aimed to identify signs of depression on English social media texts. The solution comprised data cleaning and pre-processing, the use of additional data, a method to deal with data imbalance as well as fine-tuning of two transformer-based pre-trained language models, RoBERTa-Large and DeBERTa-V3-Large. Four model architectures were developed by leveraging different word embedding pooling methods, namely a RoBERTa-Large bidirectional GRU model using GRU pooling and three DeBERTa models using CLS pooling, mean pooling and max pooling, respectively. Although ensemble learning of DeBERTa's pooling methods through majority voting was employed for better performance, the RoBERTa bidirectional GRU model managed to receive the 8$^{th}$ place out of 31 submissions with 0.42 Macro-F1 score.\n",

Once the accumulated gradients reach the target “virtual” batch size, the model weights are updated with the accumulated gradients.\n",

        "If we set *gradient_accumulation_steps* to 2, then *zero_grad()* and *optimizer.step()* will only be called every second epoch. Consequently, running the modified training loop with accumulation_steps=2 will have the same effect as doubling the batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if we want to use a batch size of 256 but can only fit a batch size of 64 into GPU memory, we can perform gradient accumulation over four batches of size 64. (After processing all four batches, we will have the accumulated gradients equivalent to a single batch of size 256. 64 * 4 = 256) This allows us to effectively emulate a larger batch size without requiring larger GPU memory or tensor sharding across different devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "While gradient accumulation can help us train models with larger batch sizes, it does not reduce the total computation required. In fact, it can sometimes lead to a slightly slower training process, as the weight updates are performed less frequently. Nevertheless, it allows us to work around limitations where we have very small batch sizes that lead to noisy updates."
